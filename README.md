# Go Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a personal collection of Go (Golang) code examples and exercises. All code here has been written as part of my learning process, closely following the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/).

## About

Every folder and file contains snippets, small projects, and experiments that helped me understand Golang concepts, standard library features, idioms, and best practices.

Whether you are learning Go, looking for simple examples, or exploring how core concepts work in practice, feel free to browse, fork, or contribute suggestions!

## What's Inside

- **Basic Syntax**: Hello world, variables, types, constants, control structures.
- **Functions & Methods**: Functions, methods, receivers, closures.
- **Structs & Interfaces**: Data structures, interfaces, composition.
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines, channels, select statements.
- **Error Handling**: Error types, custom errors, panic & recover.
- **Standard Library**: Examples using `fmt`, `os`, `io`, `http`, and more.
- **Testing**: Writing and running unit tests in Go.
- **Tools**: Usage of `go` command-line tools, dependency management.
